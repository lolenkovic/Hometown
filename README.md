This is a small school made website that i'd made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It consists CSS animations such as scaling,transforming and also onscroll effects using Javascript.
Validation of the form is made with basic alert popup ( exp: the password must consist atleast 6 characters and the confirmation of the password must match ).
